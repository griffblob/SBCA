# SBCA — Self Balancing Cube of Awesomeness

**SBCA** (Self Balancing Cube of Awesomeness) is my final year project, showcasing a self-balancing cube system — combining simulation, embedded code, and demonstration materials to explore the control logic and hardware/software integration required to balance a cube on its edge or corner.  

This project contains simulation models, example control code, and demonstration videos that illustrate the workings and behaviour of the balancing system.

## 🚀 Features

- **Control system simulation** via Simulink models.
- **Embedded code** (C/C++) for real-world implementation on microcontrollers.
- **Demo videos** showing practical hardware performance or simulation output.
